This week, I analyzed a paper called "Why, when, and from whom: considerations for collecting and reporting race and ethnicity data in HCI" by Chen, Smith, Reinecke and To. 

As the title suggests, the paper discusses the ethics behind collecting data regarding a particpants' ethicity and race for Human Computer Interaction (HCI) research. The paper highlights a lack of regulations regarding collecting sensitive data regarding a person's background, and proposes a first step towards a guideline for the same. Data collection in an age where data is being used for so many different important purposes is a very crucial step in the data process, and the ethics relating to it are a huge concern.

The paper analyzes this topic through surveys, review of prior discussion and empirical analyses of current methods. They found that less than 3% of CHI papers reported any data related to the race and ethnicity of it's particpants. They highlight that the reason the papers that do highlight race and ethnicity are to strengthen the validity of the study, and also address any potential biases in the data based on those factors. They encourage making deliberate decisions on determining from when and whom to collect data. The authors recognize several limitations with this study, including their research primarily being focused within the United States, and there existing a sampling bias within their survey population.
