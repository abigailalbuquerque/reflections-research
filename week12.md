The paper I analyzed this week is titled "A Multi-Level Typology of Abstract Visualization Tasks" by Matthew Brehmer and Tamara Munzner. You can find the paper at the following link: https://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/imager/tr/2013/MultiLevelTaskTypology/brehmer_infovis13.pdf.

This paper focuses on a new way of understanding how people use visualizations. Previous research has focused on either basic or complex visualization tasks, but not the steps in between. The authors propose a new system to categorize tasks into different levels, explaining why and how they're done, and what the inputs and outputs are. This system helps describe complex tasks as a series of simpler ones, making it easier to understand and compare different visualization techniques.

The typology is organized across three main levels:
- Why: This level addresses the user's motivations for engaging with the data visualization. It includes higher-level goals such as discovering something new, presenting information, or confirming a hypothesis.
- What: This level describes what kind of data or what aspect of the data the user is focusing on. It includes specifics such as whether the user is looking at trends, distributions, or relationships within the data.
- How: This level focuses on the methods and techniques used to carry out the tasks. It includes actions like selecting, navigating, arranging, and changing the visualization.

The intent is to help designer's better understand the tasks needed to be completed, no matter the domain of the visualization task, thus leading to better visualizations.
