This week I analyzed a paper titled "Evaluating Visualization Decision-Making with Cognitive Models" by Melanie Bancilhon, Lace Padilla, and Alvitta Ottley.

The paper is focused on the evaluation of visualizations, an essential process, which is usually done by measuring how well the visualization is at conveying information fast and accurately. The paper proposes that there should be more to evaluation than these metrics. It suggests a dual process approach to visualization evaluation.
