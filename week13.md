This week I analyzed a chapter titled "Evaluating Visualization Decision-Making with Cognitive Models" by Melanie Bancilhon, Lace Padilla, and Alvitta Ottley. You can find it here: https://visualdata.wustl.edu/assets/pdf/bancilhon2023improving.pdf.

The paper is focused on the evaluation of visualizations, an essential process, which is usually done by measuring how well the visualization is at conveying information fast and accurately. The paper proposes that there should be more to evaluation than these metrics. It suggests a dual-process approach to visualization evaluation. Dual-Process theory suggests that there exists two types of decisions operating under distinct cognitive processes: intuitive (Type 1) and strategic (Type 2) decisions, which require significantly more working memory than Type 1.

The paper highlights that research into how people think and process information can improve the design of charts and graphs. By understanding working memory, cognitive load, and decision-making theories, designers can create visualizations that are better suited to different people and tasks.
