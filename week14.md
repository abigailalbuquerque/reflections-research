This week, I analyzed a paper titled "EVM: Incorporating Model Checking into Exploratory Visual Analysis" by Alex Kale, Ziyang Guo, Xiao Li Qiao, Jeffrey Heer, Jessica Hullman. You can find the paper here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.13024.pdf.

The paper highlights data exploration tool called EVM that helps analysts better understand the data they are working with. Unlike typical visual analytics tools that only show data patterns, EVM allows users to also test these patterns against statistical models. This means analysts can see if the patterns they notice in the data actually match up with certain predictions made by these models.

EVM displays these model predictions next to the original data views, allowing for easy comparison. The paper also discusses a study involving data scientists who used this tool, and it looks at how having the ability to check models influenced their analysis process. The study found that this feature helped analysts to more deeply question and understand the reliability of the data patterns they observed. They found that model checking can improve understanding of data generating process, but only when users avoid fixating on non-conceptual aspects of analysis. They concluded that model checks can integrate cleanly into exploratory visual analysis workflows.
